# Bike Share Ridership During COVID-19
Having lived in Chicago for over a decade, riding a bike became my main form of transportation to and from work. After reading an article from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-bike-commute.html
), I wondered how ridership changed in different cities throughout the United States, particularly urban environments with multiple forms of mass transit. 

The question became: did ridership increase or decrease during the initial stages of COVID-19 at the beginning or March 2020, and how has that changed more than a year later?

Bike share rideship was researched for the following cities:
